# 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow & Keras

Welcome to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) project! This repository contains a simple implementation of an ANN using TensorFlow and Keras for classification tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras. You can customize the architecture to solve tasks like image classification, sentiment analysis, or tabular data prediction.

- **Framework**: TensorFlow & Keras  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Dataset**: Custom or Predefined (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, etc.)  
- **Training**: Supervised Learning  
- **Output**: Classification or Regression  

## 🚀 Features

- Build a multi-layer ANN with customizable neurons, layers, and activation functions.  
- Train using custom datasets or pre-loaded datasets.  
- Visualize training progress using plots.  
- Evaluate model accuracy using various metrics.  
- Save and load models.
